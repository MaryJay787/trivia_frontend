### Next Steps for Project ###
0. Get questions to appear on the frontend 

1. When user clicks on a category all the questions for that category appear bellow the categories.
    1a. After all questions appear, refactor code so that only one question appears at a time.

2. User should be able to select an answer. 
    2a. Upon user selection the user is told if the answer was right or wrong and the correct answer
    is shown.
    2b. After the correct is shown...the question is on a timer and moves to the next question. 
    
3. When there are no more questions left for that category user gets to select another category or 
    quit the game(return to main menu).

4. When MVP is completed then start working on design.
